<h1> RCViewer</h1>
<h2> A simple application to view reversible circuits</h2>
<h2> </h2>
<h2> Version 1.14</h2>
RCViewer is intended to be a simple application to aid in the
visualization of reversible quantum circuits made up of Toffoli and
Fredkin gates in cascade
format. Currently it will display a simple image for a given circuit,
and
for now can save this image as a bitmap file. More gate support and
more
image format support is planned for the future.
<p>RCViewer was written in C++ using the Windows Template Library, and
so
is currently available only for the Win32 platform. </p>
<p>RCViewer is free to distribute, although if you choose to distribute
it
over a web page, or some other large-scale form of distribution, I
would appreciate
it if you dropped me a note at <a href="mailto:y8ju8@unb.ca"
 target="_blank">
y8ju8@unb.ca</a> to let me know. Neither myself nor UNB will accept any
responsibility for any harm caused by this program or the transfer
thereof. <br>
</p>

<h2> Features:</h2>
<b>Circuit types:</b>
<ul>
  <li> Currently limited to cascades of generalized Toffoli and Fredkin
gates.</li>
  <li> Custom file format (.tfc). Syntax is provided with the sample
.tfc
files.</li>
</ul>
<b>Image exporting:</b>
<ul>
  <li> Currently can save the circuit image as a 24-bit Bitmap file.</li>
</ul>
<b>Quantum Cost:</b>
<ul>
  <li> Calculates the quantum cost of the circuit based on the latest <a
 href="definitions.html" target="_blank">
table</a>
.</li>
</ul>
<b>Output verification:</b>
<ul>
  <li> View the output of a circuit in truth-table form</li>
  <li> Verify the output of a circuit against a PLA file</li>
</ul>
<b>Customization:</b>
<ul>
  <li> Can change the appearance of the circuit by altering the colors,
size, and spacing of gates.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Instructions</h2>
Everything is pretty simple and straightforward.
<p>To open a circuit for viewing, click the folder icon on the toolbar
(folder
image), or select File/Open... from the menu bar, or use the shortcut:
Ctrl-O.
By default, files with the extension of .tfc ("Toffoli-Fredkin
Cascades")
are listed, but any file extension is valid and will be attempted to be
parsed.
Error messages will alert you to any parse errors. </p>
<p>To save a bitmap image of an open circuit, click the disk image icon
on
the toolbar, or select File/Save BMP... from the menu bar, or use the
shortcut:
Ctrl-S. The image will be saved as a 24-bit bitmap file. If no circuit
has
been opened, or if the circuit is empty (0 gates), this button does
nothing. </p>
<p>To change the look of the circuit, select Edit/Preferences... from
the menu bar, or use the shortcut: Ctrl-E. Here you can change the: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Colors. Separate colors can be chosen to draw: variable names,
constant values, garbage output, the lines themselves, gates, and the
background color.
Now you can show off your circuits in stylish hot-pink on yellow
background,
should you so desire!</li>
  <li> Sizes and spaces. Change the size of: target symbols, control
symbols. Change the space: between lines (vertical), and between gates
(horizontal).</li>
  <li> Ordering. Have the variables drawn from top-to-bottom (in the
order
specified in the tfc file) or from bottom-to-top.</li>
</ul>
To view the I/O of a circuit, click on the "IO" button on the toolbar,
or
select View/Input/Output from the menu bar, or use the shortcut:
Ctrl-I. Input
values are listed ignoring the constant input lines, and output values
are
listed ignoring the garbage output variables.
<p>To compare the output of a circuit to a PLA file, click the "PLA"
button on the toolbar, or select File/Verify With PLA... from the menu
bar. The program
will try and match output variables from the currently opened circuit
to
the output lines from the chosen PLA file. If successful, the program
will
report which Circuit output lines map to which PLA output lines.
Otherwise, the program will report that the circuit and PLA files do
not have equivalent output. </p>
<p>To view the cost statistics of an open circuit, click the "Q" icon
on the
toolbar, or select View/Quantum Cost, or use the shortcut: Ctrl-Q. A
message
box will appear, telling you: the gate count of the circuit, the number
of
garbage bits, and the estimated quantum cost taken from the latest
tables. </p>
<p>The circuit image will wrap if it is longer than the window's width
(as
well as a bit of bordering space.) However, if the window is too small
(narrower
than 200 pixels, technically,) the circuit will not be drawn at all.
Saved
bitmap files will appear exactly as they do in the window (only without
any
excess whitespace), so be sure to play with the window size and the
preferences
to produce the image you want. <br>
</p>

<h2> Future plans:</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Provide more image format options for saving</li>
  <li> Clean up some of the code structure, open it up to allow for
easy
addition of gate types</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2> Version History</h2>
<ul>
  <li> 1.0 - First version. Supports Toffoli and Fredkin gates only.
Supports bitmap files for image saving. Can customize color and spacing
of gates and
lines.</li>
  <li> 1.01 - Added ParseException for including a .c list in the file
when
there are no constants expected. Added option to list variables from
either
top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top.</li>
  <li> 1.02 - Fixed silly bug when drawing Fredkin gates from bottom to
top.</li>
  <li> 1.1 - Added Input/Output viewing and PLA file verification
features.</li>
  <li> 1.11 - Improved PLA parsing. Sped up scrolling through IO for
larger
circuits. Tweaked default preferences.</li>
  <li> 1.12 - Reverted I/O viewing to text. Fixed some scrolling bugs.</li>
  <li> 1.13 - Optional Output variable tags added.</li>
  <li>1.132 - The quantum cost table was updated based on the <a
 href="papers/0403053.pdf">new results</a>.</li>
  <li>1.14 - The quantum cost table was updated based on the <a
 href="papers/09G_3_586.pdf">newer results</a>.</li>
</ul>
