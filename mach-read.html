Format Description</font></font></b></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <b>machine-readable format</b> is a .tfc
file
which consists of the following strings.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
1<sup>st</sup> string is the list of all variables (lines)
participating
in the calculation; all entities are deliminated by commas. This string
starts with the keyword ".v ".</li>
  <li>
2<sup>nd</sup> string is the ordered list of all input variables
(lines)
for the function to be calculated with the entities deliminated by
commas.
The beginning of this list is labeled with ".i ".</li>
  <li>
3<sup>rd</sup> string is the list of output lines separated by commas;
it starts with the control sequence ".o ". Optional string starting
with
quantifier ".ol" defines the labels for the outputs in the order they
appear
in the output list. If output labels are not specified, the program
will
assign the input labels to the corresponding output.</li>
  <li>
4<sup>th</sup> string contains values for the input constants in the
order
they appear on the first string without any spaces. If no input
constants
are needed, this string is not present. This string starts with ".c ".</li>
  <li>
5<sup>th</sup> string, and every non-empty string thereafter, contain
either:
a) the word "BEGIN" indicating the beginning of a network, b) exactly
one
gate written in the form described below c) the word "END" indicating
the
end of the circuit. The file should list the gates in the order they
appear
in the actual design.</li>
  <li>
The circuit file may also include comments, indicated by a "#" symbol
in
the beginning of a string.</li>
</ul>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><b>Gate types.</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Toffoli gates </b>are written as "tn ", where "t" indicates
Toffoli
and "n" is the size of the Toffoli gate (number of variables in it)
followed
by the list of variables, such that the EXORed variable (target of the
gate) is at the end of the list.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Fredkin gates</b> are written as "fn ", where "f" indicates
Fredkin
and "n" is the size of the corresponding Fredkin gate followed by the
list
of variables, such that the SWAPed variables (targets of the gate) are
at the end of the list.</li>
</ul>
<i>Examples.</i>
<li>NOT gate is a TOF(&Oslash;;a) gate which in machine-readable format
should
be written as "<font face="Arial,Helvetica">t1 a</font>".</li>
<li>
CNOT gate is a TOF(a;b) gate which in machine-readable format should be
written as "<font face="Arial,Helvetica">t2 a,b</font>".</li>
<li>
Original Toffoli gate is a TOF(a,b;c) gate which in machine-readable
format
should be written as "<font face="Arial,Helvetica">t3 a,b,c</font>".</li>
<li>
SWAP gate is a FRE(&Oslash;;a,b) gate which in machine-readable format
looks as "f<font face="Arial,Helvetica">2 a,b</font>".</li>
<li>
Original Fredkin gate is a FRE(a;b,c) which in machine-readable format
looks as "f3<font face="Arial,Helvetica"> a,b,c</font>".</li>
