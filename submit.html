<p>If you wish to publish reversible synthesis results on this web
page,
please attach the list of functions that you have as well as a separate
<a href="definitions.html">machine-readable file</a> for each of your
designs
in an e-mail to <a href="mailto:dmitri.maslov@gmail.com">Dmitri Maslov</a>.
The
pictorial representation and quantum cost calculation will be done
automatically
by our program. If your synthesis is done in a different (other than <a
 href="index.html">listed</a>)
model, please, send us the calculation of quantum cost and model
description;
we will do our best to make a fair comparison of your results to the
posted
ones. Finally, if you wish to write a few words on how did you achieve
your results, you are also very welcome. Once the results are
published,
they will not be removed. The main criteria for publishing the result
is
absence of a better design in the sense that if your circuit has the
cost
count defined by the vector <b><i>(x,y,z)</i></b>, which is garbage -
gate
count - quantum cost, there should be no design with cost vector <b><i>(a,b,c)
</i></b>such
that <b><i>a&lt;x</i></b>, <b><i>b&lt;y</i></b> and <b><i>c&lt;z</i></b>
which is already posted.
